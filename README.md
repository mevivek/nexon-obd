# NexonOBD

Live telemetry and UDS diagnostics for a **2022 Tata Nexon 1.2 petrol (BS6)**, built on a
**Seeed XIAO ESP32S3**. The board hosts its own Wi-Fi access point and serves a gauge
dashboard, a UDS identifier scanner, and browser-based OTA updates — no laptop, no app,
no cloud.

It reaches the car two ways and picks whichever works:

| Transport | Hardware | Speed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BLE ELM327** | none — uses a dual-mode ELM327 already in the OBD port | ~2 Hz | Works today |
| **Direct CAN** | SN65HVD230 transceiver (~₹200) | 50–100 Hz | Preferred once wired |

Everything here was verified against the actual vehicle. Where a claim is untested,
it says so.

---

## Quick start

1. Flash the firmware (see [Building](#building)).
2. Power the board — USB, or from the OBD port via a 12 V→5 V buck.
3. Join Wi-Fi **`NexonOBD`** / **`nexon1234`**.
4. Open **`http://192.168.4.1`**.

| Page | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/` | Live gauges — RPM, boost, temps, trims, lambda, catalyst |
| `/scan` | UDS service `0x22` identifier sweep, with CSV export |
| `/update` | Upload a new `.bin` over Wi-Fi |
| `/dtc` | Stored + pending fault codes as JSON |
| `/data` | Current sample as JSON |

The onboard LED encodes state, which matters when the board is hidden under the dash:

- **slow blink (1 Hz)** — alive, Wi-Fi up, ECU not answering
- **fast blink (5 Hz)** — talking to the ECU
- **double-blink** — DID scan running

## Hardware

### Option A — no extra parts

Uses a dual-mode ELM327 clone over **BLE GATT**. The ESP32-S3 has **no Bluetooth Classic
radio**, so it cannot use the usual SPP path — but many ELM327 clones also expose a BLE
interface, and this firmware drives that.

Check yours advertises service `FFF0`. On the unit this was built against:

```
BLE address 81:23:45:67:89:BA   name "OBDBLE"
  SERVICE 0000fff0
    CHAR 0000fff1  Read, Notify               <- responses
    CHAR 0000fff2  WriteWithoutResponse, Write <- commands
```

Note the BLE address is the Classic MAC with the top bit of octet 0 set
(`01:…` → `81:…`). Set `ELM_BLE_ADDR` in `elm_ble.h` to match your adapter.

### Option B — direct CAN (recommended)

| Part | Notes |
|---|---|
| **SN65HVD230** transceiver | **3.3 V part.** Do *not* use TJA1050 or MCP2551 — they are 5 V logic and will damage the ESP32's RX pin |
| 12 V→5 V buck (MP1584/LM2596) | Set output to 5 V *before* connecting the board |
| OBD-II male pigtail | |

**Wiring**

| XIAO ESP32S3 | SN65HVD230 |
|---|---|
| D1 (GPIO2) | CTX / D |
| D2 (GPIO3) | CRX / R |
| 3V3 | VCC |
| GND | GND |

| SN65HVD230 | OBD-II pin |
|---|---|
| CANH | 6 |
| CANL | 14 |

Power from OBD pin 16 (+12 V) and pin 4/5 (GND) into the buck, 5 V out to the XIAO's `5V` pad.

> **Remove the 120 Ω termination resistor** on the transceiver breakout. The vehicle bus
> is already terminated at both ends; a third terminator causes bus errors.

> **OBD pin 16 is permanently live.** The firmware deep-sleeps after 10 minutes with no
> ECU response, but unplug it if the car is parked for days.

## Building

Requires `arduino-cli` and the ESP32 core (note: ~6 GB unpacked).

```bash
arduino-cli config add board_manager.additional_urls \
  https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json
arduino-cli core update-index
arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32

arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:XIAO_ESP32S3 firmware/NexonOBD
arduino-cli upload -p COM3 --fqbn esp32:esp32:XIAO_ESP32S3 firmware/NexonOBD
```

Current size: **1.18 MB flash (35 %)**, 48 KB RAM (14 %).

The default `default_8MB` partition already provides `ota_0` + `ota_1` at 3.19 MB each,
so OTA works without changing the partition scheme.

### OTA

```bash
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:XIAO_ESP32S3 --output-dir build firmware/NexonOBD
```

Then join `NexonOBD` and upload `build/NexonOBD.ino.bin` at `http://192.168.4.1/update`.

The board runs from `app0`; an upload streams into `app1`; `otadata` only flips once
`Update.end()` verifies the image, then it reboots. An interrupted or corrupt upload never
touches `otadata`, so **a failed OTA cannot brick the board** — it reboots into the
firmware it was already running.

**From a phone, with no dev machine:** every push to `main` runs
[`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml), which compiles the firmware
and publishes `NexonOBD.ino.bin` as a build artifact. Download it from the Actions tab on
your phone, join the board's Wi-Fi, upload it at `/update`.

That is the whole edit-from-mobile loop: change code → push → CI builds → download `.bin`
→ flash over Wi-Fi.

```

Both transports implement the same contract — request bytes in, reassembled ISO-TP
payload out — so mode 01, mode 03 and UDS `0x22` are written once and work on either.

`chooseTransport()` prefers CAN when the transceiver answers, else falls back to BLE, and
re-evaluates every 20 s while the ECU is silent.

## Safety

This firmware is **read-only by design**. It sends mode 01 (live data), mode 03/07 (fault
codes), mode 09 (vehicle info), UDS `0x22` (ReadDataByIdentifier), and ISO-TP flow
control. It never sends:

| Service | Why not |
|---|---|
| `0x2E` WriteDataByIdentifier | writes ECU memory |
| `0x31` RoutineControl | triggers actuators |
| `0x11` ECUReset | resets a live ECU |
| `0x10` DiagnosticSessionControl | changes ECU state |
| `0x27` SecurityAccess | unlocks protected functions |

Run scans **parked**. Reading is safe; a stalled request while driving is not worth the risk.
